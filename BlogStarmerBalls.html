        <p> So apparently Kier Starmer has the “balls” to reduce Britain’s “benefits” bill. He was quoted as saying “We will be ruthless with cuts if that’s what’s necessary”. Yes Kier that is pretty ruthless but is it necessary? Or are you trying to sound like a “strong man” leader? There are a couple of things about this statement that I think need addressing. Our establishment refuses to stop living in the lies that have been perpetuated for years and years and this is one of the main reasons it’s losing the fight to populism and fascism. So I’m going to breath for a second, try not to melt into a puddle of swearing and vitriol for the cowardice I see around every corner and take this point by point. 
          <br>
          <p>Firstly they are NOT benefits. It’s one of those loaded words used to describe something that is very emotive. Only it doesn’t really describe the thing in question at all, the word has been misappropriated onto something, and it has been done for a reason. In this reason benefits is being used to describe support but support suggests that someone needs help and benefits, well benefits doesn’t.</p> 
          <br>
          <p>Benefits!</p>
          <br> 
          <p>It’s like a bonus right? a good thing?  When you join a gym and get the BENEFIT of using their spa facilities, that’s a benefit. When your daughter starts dating a web developer and you get to ask him about the state of the website you have responsibility for despite knowing squat about websites, that’s a benefit. Getting support from the state because you are struggling, or because you are financially stretched is NOT a benefit. It could, I guess be explained as a benefit of living in a country with a functioning state and compassion about its population but benefit suggests that this is some sort of perk or prize. I don’t hear the media talking about tax breaks and loop holes as benefits. Oh no no!  These are very serious things that absolutely NEED to happen for the continued existence of those people and businesses that are rolling in so much money they don’t even know what to do with it and of course by extension the fabric of all reality. To deprive a poor millionaire of even a tiny fraction of their wealth is akin to committing species suicide to hear them talk about.</p> 
          <br>
          <p>Essential.</p>
          <br>
          <p>FUCKING ESSENTIAL.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Only not really, more just incredibly greedy and detrimental.</p> 
          <br>
          <p>So job one, stop calling it benefits, you know what people hear when you call it benefits? (I have framed this as a question as if they don’t know what people hear and it isn’t exactly why this word has been appropriated)</p> 
          <br>
          <p>They hear that someone is receiving something that not only is the person not getting themselves but also that they are paying for other people (or skivers as the Tories want us to think of them as, see, words again) to be awarded for not going to work. Of course tax is far more complicated than that but why explain anything, if we explain it and people understand then they will see through the bullshit and that won’t help politicians to get so many people to continually vote against their own interests. But these people get mad because the person out of work is being paid to have a great time at home and go on all these holidays. They always, absolutely ALWAYS know of someone who does this. Forget the fact that they know lots and lots of people and I doubt they would honestly be able to say that most people they know would scam the system. It’s the opposite usually isn’t it, they know of one person so they would rather frame anyone they don’t personally know and have heard the excuses of as scum bags. It’s a lie the actual scum bags with power keep telling you so we hate each other rather than looking at them shafting us.  Even Tony Blair said apparently you can self diagnose a mental illness and get all the benefits. No Tony you can’t decide you have a mental health problem and get state support, even when you actually have a mental health problem getting support is not only extremely difficult but is getting harder and harder due to waiting times and people like you saying things that make no sense. But it all fits in the pattern, lets call them benefits like it’s a prize to be won. Most people don’t want to be supported by the state, firstly so many people are so fucking cruel about it why would you want to, secondly most people will sort themselves out given the money to do so. Cutting benefits will help no one, punishing people who need help will not help them, they won’t magically suddenly be able to and be able to get work. It doesn’t work like that, but benefits doesn’t bring images of someone who needs to pay bills and make ends meet, its gives the image of someone getting their weekly prize. We are quibbling about a financial drop in the ocean compared to wasted money and that money ring fenced by the 1% of the planet WHO ACTUALLY OWNS ALL THE GOD DAMN MONEY. This fast and loose playing with language:</p>
          <br>
          <p>Efficiency savings = cutting everything to the bone except the pay of the top heads,</p> 
          <br>
          <p>Sustainability = cutting everything to the bone so the top heads can get paid obscene amounts,</p>
          <br> 
          <p>Hard Left (Democrats, Non-far right media)= Right wing as fuck but not quite as right wing as fascism,</p> 
          <br>
          <p>This tactic is offensive to me, and it is certainly Orwellian enough for me to actually fear this weaponisation of language. Don’t believe it’s a weapon, see peoples reaction to words like socialism then ask them to explain what it is. By ingraining state support as benefits is an attack on the poor, plain and simple and the “adults” or the “sensible” “centre left” Labour party are too weak to even challenge this simple fact. So don’t call them benefits.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Then there is the actual function of welfare. It’s there to help people become a functioning part of society, most very wealthy people will never understand this because they have no conception of the idea that you may not have enough money to make ends meet. They have no conception that being successful in life is infinitely harder is you don’t have a pot of money that already means you don’t have to worry about how you will pay bills, put food on your table and deal with any issues that might arise in your life. Most wealthy people will not realise that making fortunes when you start with millions is a fucking doddle, you can fail upwards, just look at Trump, if he’d just put his “small 1 million dollar inheritance”, yes this man thinks a million is a small number, in a savings account it would have made him more money than his business ventures. But how can you fail when you start with such obscene amounts of money, and how can you possibly understand how the rest of us live, when it’s UNECESSARY to do so. If we ACTUALLY want a strong economy money needs to move around to the poor and working and middle classes, you know the ones who will actually spend their money in England, in shops etc, that’s how you stimulate an economy, you don’t give the poor and working class less and less and less and expect them to magically become a strong working force. It is actually true you get what you pay for and Labour wants to pay nothing for their population and expects us to work for them, it’s laughable, flip this around and the rich would laugh in your face, they already are starting to wring their hands and make threats at even the smallest threat to their massive wealth not being as massive as before, because they act like an asset in a capitalist world, thing is they are assets, but they are not the asset that we the working, poor, middle classes are. They refer to themselves as the wealth creators but they aren’t, we are. We’re the ones who do the work, make things run and SPEND OUR MONEY. I find it ironic that the people benefiting the most from capitalism are the worst capitalists ever. Well I would find it ironic if it wasn’t clear what is going on. These guys do love capitalism, for us. They love the all or nothing danger of life, for us. For them they want socialism, tax breaks, support for any loss of earning, second chance after second chance after second chance, do they realise they have socialism whilst vilifying socialism for those who actually need it? I don’t know but it is damn infuriating.</p>
          <br>
          <p>So Kier Starmer has the “balls” to cut benefits. That’s not balls. When you HAVE to fight someone in the room and one is the infirm old man and the other is the former heavyweight boxer having the “balls” to fight the infirm old man is what a fucking idiot would claim. But again they lean into the world view of the populist, fascist, massive fucking babies. Being cruel is NOT ballsy. Taking more support from the poorest to avoid having a head on with the lobbyists is NOT FUCKING BALLSY. It’s fucking cowardice. And then to crow about it like the damn temu version of Trump or Putin is just sad. Who the fuck are you trying to appeal to Starmer? The fascists, because guess what? They will never EVER think you are fascist enough, you will always be the pussy version of the Tories and it will bite you in the arse the second things slip. 
          <br>
          <p>So you want to look like a strong man do you Kier? Want people to thing you aren’t soft? Here are my tips.
              <ol>
              <li>Doing the easy thing is NOT hard, its what “Strong Man” politicians do and it isn’t hard. It's pathetic, you pick a group of people you are far more powerful than and drop a ton of bricks on them saying you have the “balls” to make the tough decisions, that isn’t a tough decision, you can pretend fighting is the hard choice all you want but it isn’t, it’s the cowards choice when YOU aren’t the one doing any actual fucking fighting. </li>
              <br>
              <li>Challenge the lies perpetuated time and again, why not be honest? If you have balls why not admit that you don’t have the will or strength to fight a system that is clearly so unfair. Why not stop taking the legal fucking bribes by entities with all the money and all the reason to want to influence you instead of shrugging and musing how we would be so crazy as to suggest that maybe you should pay for your own Arsenal Season ticket, or even yes, shock horror, not actually go to see Arsenal but watch it at home. </li>
              <br>
              <li>Actually stand for something, you don’t stand for a damn thing. You talked about being a socialist, talked about helping Britain but when you get in it’s just more of the same, lame ineffectual politics that follows the rights lead and will be absolutely decimated by that same right wing when something they would have made even worse goes wrong (financial crisis, the tories were up in arms labour didn’t de regulate the banks even further, it was this de regulation in the US that would allow the sub prime mortgage fiasco to ultimately break our economy).</li>
              <br>
              <li>Don’t defend a genocide because you have an arms deal to protect. A Strong man would not be so ethically impotent. A real strong man would have the ACTUAL balls to admit what they are seeing and acknowledge it. They would not go to Auschwitz and somehow suggests it’s strengthened your resolve to support a government to carry out a genocide. No matter how much they want to Israel cannot claim to speak for and de facto BE the whole of Judaism and that government can try to use the shield of the horror perpetrated on the Jews by the Nazis to do what the Nazis did to the Jews to the Palestinians but that shit wont wash 100 years from now. In 100 years history will judge your actions the same as those who supported and enabled the Nazis. </li>
              <br>
              <li>Explain how you can continue to talk about issues with the countries finances and tightening of belts and cutting budgets when the rich are getting richer? All the Tory talk during austerity (it’s still happening even though it was proven to not work almost 100 years ago in the USA) and the pandemic of us all being in it together. It’s a bold faced fucking lie. If we are all in it together why is the inequality gap rising? Why are we constantly being told about the need to give us less and less whilst the rich are giving themselves more and more? If we were actually all in this together, if austerity actually worked wouldn’t we all get richer? Or all get poorer? But what has happened is the vast majority of people above been getting poorer and poorer whilst the few wealthiest have been getting richer and richer. Now an actual strong leader, not the ridiculous idea of a strong leader like Putin or Trump, thin skinned, vain, cruel idiots who would watch the entire world burn if it meant they could stay as “top man” for another day, an actual strong leader would explain this to us, fix it because fixing it is the right thing to do for the vast majority of us, because taking from them is the equivalent of one less ivory back scratcher whilst taking from us is entering the skipping meals, going cold in your own house etc realms.
              </ol>
            <br>
            <p>I’d very much like to believe that Labour can actually help the country, that their actions won’t just be some pathetic attempt to look like fascists whilst leaving the door wide open to Reform. I’d love to believe that Labour would have the strength to stand up for what is right. But I don’t have the faith. And every day that goes by, every new story I hear, I despair and I search. I keep looking, eyes peeled desperate to see some sign. I’ll continue to search but I fear I will never again be able to find a spine in the ranks of politicians in the cabinet.
            <br>
            <p>As far as I can tell Labour stands for nothing, so as is always the way, they fall for everything. If only their fall didn’t mean we all go down with them.</p>
