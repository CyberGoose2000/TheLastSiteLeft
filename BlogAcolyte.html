        <p class="blog-post-meta">December 23, 2024 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>
        <p> I have a weird relationship with popular culture. What I mean by that is with most pop culture I'm years behind. This includes listening to music, watching television shows, watching films and playing games, there's a good chance I'm years behind. This has nothing to do with whether it's something I'm interested in like the MCU films and shows or something I'm told from a reliable source I'll like. My old house mate knows me well, he knows what I like. Whenever he would tell me to watch something it wouldn’t be because he liked it but because he knew I would like it. He would get furious at how long it would take me to pick up on anything he told me to watch, read, play etc. What I'm trying to say is I'm behind a lot of the time. And I don’t really keep up on pop culture news and social media. Most of my knowledge of current events going on that are not on the front page of the Guardian website are from my friends. So, I watched The Acolyte recently, one of the Disney Plus Star Wars TV shows. I know Star Wars has had a rocky road since Disney bought it. The fans, as a default, are;</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Angry at something Disney has done to Star Wars (I say something, I really mean they have a list);</li>
            <li>Hate half or more of the Star Wars media and take this all very very seriously;</li>
            <li>Are incapable of making a comment about Star Wars that doesnt relate back to liberals and wokeness ruining the planet.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>I'm pretty sure it's the same with most fan bases in 2024. Being a fan has become being in constant combat, gate keeping what being a "true fan" is, implying a relationship in which they are personally owed for their fandom and building up any critique into a hyperbole filled politically damning verbal mauling. It's easy to do, discourse has become irate as standard, discussing has been replaced by shouting points at one another never listening for a response, and there seems to be a real issue in being able to differentiate subjective criticism with objective criticism. This is all difficult enough when the points being squawked about are solely within the realm of the fandom but all too often fandoms have had their loves become inescapably combined with the cultural argument around "wokeness" and all that comes with that. Star Wars has had its issues with the "wokeness" argument since the Force Awakens and the question of whether "diversity" is hurting Star Wars and what ulterior motives Disney may have in its casting choices etc seems to be under constant scrutiny.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So, I have an idea of the general sentiment towards Star Wars (and there is a LOT of sentiment) and I knew that the Acolyte had been received poorly but I'm well beyond listening to reviews for this type of thing, so I decided to watch the whole thing. And I did. Now this is my fault, I did not bother to read anything further until I had watched it. One of the things I thought at the end of the show was "you know this could be one of those shows that really hits its stride two or three seasons in" and then I immediately read that the show had been cancelled. I blame myself for doing this, but I needed to know why, and this is where I am eternally struggling. I don't want to care about this stuff, I don't want to get so worked up, but I do care and apparently, I like to torture myself. I did a quick google search to investigate why the show had been cancelled and the first thing I came across was a quote from an article explaining that there was a disagreement about what Star Wars was. Now for my second mistake, I immediately assumed that it was a nerd issue, that they had made changes to the Star Wars world that angered a large amount of the fan base. I was so confused. This is pretty much exactly what the old republic type eras had always been portrayed as. Droids, Jedi, light sabres, Sith, witches, blasters... there was nothing in it that hadn't already been established. So, I continued to investigate the reasons behind cancelation and saw where I had been going wrong. There isn't a white male main character. The director is gay, one of the lead actors is gay, the witches are kind of implied to be lesbians (I mean if you think it through what they have actually done to make the kids isn’t even clear but at least one woman may romantically like one other woman so there's a gay agenda I guess). The diversity was an afront it seems. Then I saw some of the launch interviews and the joke about R2D2 being a lesbian, and the right-wing media having a meltdown about a joke that the Simpsons did 2 decades ago.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Apparently, this is what we are teaching kids, I don't even know how a media interview for a tv series launch counts as educational material that "they" would use to teach your children, but it feels like I don’t know how 90% of the logic of 90% of the planet works anymore anyway. So someone mentioned this is the "gayest" Star Wars ever. It was a dumb comment, I mean it may be true but in terms of the show there isn’t really any strong romantic angle involved so straight, or gay isn’t really a thing in the show. Outside the show the cast and crew do have high profile homosexuals so there is an argument to be made. Thing is if you have no interest in gay pride why would you care about this? Do you have the same political response to overly sweet puffing up of "manly" or "straight" films and shows? If people are being nauseating with their praise how much does it really affect you? Why are you framing their love of something as though it is being aimed at you? Unless you want it to. Or unless you do actually think the world revolves around you, everything that happens is happening to you even if it doesn’t involve you. You know who acts like that? School yard bullies, the types of children that made everyone elses life harder because they absolutely needed to judge everyone for everything. The kids that knew the rules but acted like the rules were only applicable when it would be to the advantage of the bully. Increasingly this is the mentality of people, and for white people they are being egged on by supposedly serious news outlets and right wing speakers who I sometimes suspect may actually think they are serious and not what they are, a fucking joke. It’s like they want to live in a world where YOU are the centre of the universe and so everything they say is framed around this idea like it is real that you are the centre of the universe, that this is a reasonable rationale for life and that your position as centre of the universe should be violently defended. This mentality IS the mentality of a bully. They are so sure they are so much smarter than they actually are they come up with a "clever" circular logic response to the what the teacher is trying to teach. What they say makes no sense to anyone with understanding of the subject but it sounds good and the rest of the class has no understanding on the subject so it sounds logical to them. The other kids can’t tell that the bully is talking nonsense because the teacher has not yet explained what is being taught, the bully now has a shit eating grin on their face, the only way the teacher can get the bully and the rest of the kids to understand how stupid and misguided the bully is being is by teaching them the subject, only no one is listening anymore, they think the bully has outsmarted the teacher, they only listen to the bully now, and they are all failing their school exams, and the bully will of course blame the teacher for this. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Do I need to say it?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ok.</p>
        <br>
        <p>No.</p>
        <br>
        <p>No one is teaching children that R2D2 is a lesbian, but if they were what would that even mean? Why is this dangerous? You have an American President Elect who is talking about “going after” the “enemy within”, vague references indeed but it’s sinister undertones around witch hunts, the COINTELPRO and police states are clear. But no, Star Wars is what will destroy the moral fabric of society. Who someone chooses to love is a threat to us all aparantly. A threat to a coward maybe. I wouldn't like society to dictate to me who I am and who I am not allowed to love and I expect pretty much every human alive is the same.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So I took it in, I wasn’t surprised, just disappointed. Disappointed in Disney’s inability to release a Star Wars without some sort of controversy. Let me be clear, this should not have been controversial, nothing in the Acolyte (I bet you even forgot what show I was talking about) is interesting enough to be controversial but in 2024 anything Star Wars, Disney, lacking a lead white male, includes someone who isn’t straight, etc, is controversial. I’m disappointed in capitalism and the failure of the supposed mystical “markets” to realign and either put Star Wars out of its misery or to force them to actually make shows people like. This would work if capitalism worked in the way it was intended to but neither capitalism nor Star Wars seem to work in 2024 (just like everything else). Mostly I’m disappointed in myself for even looking into this because now I have bile in my stomach that needs evacuating.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Why exactly was Star Wars The Acolyte destroying Star Wars and by extension the entire world? Remember if a white male incel fascist is personally offended then the world by default should be personally offended on their behalf.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Their argument is that Star Wars is not representative and Disney forcing representation onto Star Wars is some evil attempt to influence minds.  This is what the vague term “liberal elite”  alludes to. Well firstly it is laughably stupid, it isn’t even complex enough to start scratching at the surface. Firstly who is the liberal elite? It is thrown around so often but no doubt most would not be able to explain, and even if they did the person next to them would have a different explanation. I feel that the right has leant on this more and more as the years have gone on. The liberal elite stands for - anyone who has any amount of wealth or power who I don’t like, they could be real or made up it doesn’t matter, if I keep blaming the “liberal elite” and make them the enemy then when I tear down my rivals my base will have been prepared. So Disney is the liberal elite? Don’t make me fucking laugh. Disney is a corporation that has way to much influence and money, but liberal elite? Why because they have women and other races in your Star Wars? In the words of Ellen Ripley they don’t do this shit because they are liberal, they do it for “a goddam percentage”. They want money, they have boards of idiots, sorry people, boards of people who are trying to game every single thing they do to make the most money, like there is a trick with making us part with our cash (rather than there being hundreds of different tricks that may persuade us to buy or not buy their shit) like there is just the right mix of issues people seem to care about and things they like where if we get the percentages just right everyone will like it and we can get ALL the money. Only humans don’t work like that, and art is way to subjective to game like that. How about writing a decent fucking script Disney? Maybe that would help. But the idea that Disney (birthed by notorious antisemite Walt Disney) would have a political agenda of trying to make the world “woke” rather than their political agenda of making a dump truck full of money is laughable. </p>
        <br>
        <p>So Disney wants to put more diverse people in their media and I again ask, why the fuck would anyone be so strongly against that? I’m a white male, and I can tell that most of what I saw growing up was centred around a white male. Framed from a white male’s perspective with a white male being the central hero was just standard. As a child I had a direct role model in almost everything I watched so why shouldn’t a black kid have this? Or a woman? The argument seems to flip depending on what is being said. On one hand white men are losing all their role models and it’s terrible but the flip side is, other types of people are starting to be front and centre and its unnecessary and politicising. Well which one is it? Because it seems these people want to be able to frame role models and media representation as entirely political when it comes to white men and their portrayals whilst bemoaning the politicisation of media when someone who isn’t a white man is prominent. It again comes back to a child bully mentality, I’m smart enough to understand fairness and will cry and moan and shout the second I can in any way suggest that something is not fair on me, at the same time I don’t want anyone else to have anything and any time something isn’t fair on them and they voice it they are cry-babies. This shit was annoying at school, in the real world it is absolutely pathetic. This doesn’t just permeate into the characters in the media now, it goes to people working in the industry. The issues of representation are framed by these people as, “so we are going to deprive white men of jobs to be more inclusive?”. Making out that what has been happening before is only the absolute best person got into any of these positions, and it just so happens that white men are ALWAYS best suited, all good stories worth looking at were written by white men and the best actors in the world are all white men?</p>
        <br>
        <p>I’m sure some racists would argue this is the case but just from my life experience so far this must be wrong. So actually what has been happening for years is people who were not white men were not getting the chance to prove themselves and now they are. This is immediately countered with arguments that the companies making these things are sacrificing the story to put in what they think is necessary and I totally think this is happening, but to conclude that its the diversity and a lack of white men that is ruining the films rather than script, pacing, editing etc is just disingenuous unless of course you do actually hate people just because they might be a woman, or Asian or not look, think, talk and act like you do but if that’s where you stand then I guess the only thing I can say is that your shitty opinion is shitty and you need to grow a spine. On top of this, making out things were fair and merit based before and now diversity is making them unfair is just funny to me, this argument only makes sense if we take as a given that white men are in fact better and more important than anyone else, I reject that notion, white men include Donald Trump, Nigel Farage, Elon Musk and Vladimir Putin, there’s no way white men are just superior. What they are good at it seems is turning positive progress into a nightmare. They claim it’s everyone else that’s the problem whilst they are the ones doing all the hand wringing and shouting and moaning. Did anyone bemoan the Alien Trilogy? Was it woke because it’s main character was a bad ass woman? You know Alien had a lot of themes of motherhood? Was it suddenly unrelatable to men because it was angled from a woman’s point of view and experience? No because none of that mattered when it came to sitting down and watching the film, Sigourney Weaver nailed it and Alien and Aliens were awesome, and Alien 3 was ropey. Was “wokeness” to blame for Alien 3 not hitting the mark, no. But of course, the Alien films came out before it became popular to cause a massive stink like a child because the world seems to be acknowledging that it hasn’t really been very fair. One could almost be forgiven for concluding that all this wokeness argument has been entirely manufactured by people who would rather we be at each other’s throats than watching the people who really need to be watched closely.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Being against the “wokeness” is one thing but here’s the bit that really gets me. It’s the projection. The alt-right hates “wokness” (being aware of injustices) and they hate snowflakes and despite this they don't seem to have cottoned on to the fact that they are literally the biggest snowflakes on the planet. Not only this but they are snowflakes who seem to think absolutely anything that happens that they don’t like is an injustice systemically being perpetrated on them, you know the thing that wokeness is all about.  Women have been systemically paid less for the entirety of human existence compared to men, black people have been slaved, marginalised and disproportionately treated by law enforcement, most ethnic minorities have suffered racial abuse just going about their day to day lives, women spend a lot of their normal day to day time actively assessing the potential threats they may be under. But this is all bollocks and whining according to a group of people who feels they are “the most persecuted people on the planet” because their new Star Wars doesn’t have a white male front and centre? If that isn’t the act of an ACTUAL snowflake I don’t know what is. Theres a new spider-man who is Latino/African-American, the old white Peter Parker Spider-man is around still but now there’s a new one as well, and these complete babies cry that they are under attack. Grow the fuck up. Unfortunately it doesn’t help when politicians and people of importance, you know people who are supposed to be adult and serious, stoke these flames and encourage these babies to keep up their whining. As far as I can tell it’s the very people who claim to be fighting “wokeness” who keep talking about it, keep coming up with reasons people are supposed to be upset and have no problem making massive mountains out of tiny mole hills. These people are the route of this problem. They are self serving shits who do not care if the rest of the world is a miserable hateful place as long as they get exactly what they want whenever they want it. They’ve largely created a world full of injustice, then created a “serious” panic about people beginning to acknowledge the unjust world, then project that people being aware of this injustice are really the ones who want the world to be unjust. That is some mind-bending logic there. How on earth are you supposed to rationally argue a point when the anger comes from a place so baffling, a place that is so clearly lined with utter bullshit.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This goes beyond media of course. Think for a second about any of todays cultural arguments. Who’s a snowflake, why wokeness, who wants to shag who, what is gender etc. It’s the alt-right pundits who are fucking obsessed. They’re the ones ALWAYS talking about it. It’s them who are constantly attacking white males reminding them they should feel attacked and marginalized because homosexuals exist or some shit. It’s them that want to frame not having all media look at white males as the centre of attention as equating to “the most marginalised people on the planet” whilst at the same time persuading you that “no no that doesn’t make you a snowflake, it’s everyone else you don’t like, THEY’RE the snowflakes. They are the ones obsessed with this wokeness.”. It’s what the political parties on the right and the alt-right have absolutely mastered, they are the kings of projection, they illustrate to you the worst possible person and what they explain is themselves, but then they assign those attribute onto their enemies. It makes sense and unfortunately it clearly works. The likes of Donald Trump would very well know what a “bad person” is like, he is the baddest of bad people, so all his supporters hate Trumps enemies because, well Trump makes out they are like him. They aren’t like him for the most part, he is like him.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So babies made an absolute furore out of absolutely nothing and what did Disney do? They cancelled the next season of the Acolyte. Oh yes, Disney, champions of wokeness, with their insidious agenda of making us all gender bending gays for, reasons, have pulled the Acolyte. Is it because we found out about them trying to destroy the world? Or is it because they crunched the numbers and realised that they may not actually make any money out of this now so they axed it? I’m going to guess the latter is closer to the truth. The problem is the precedent it sets. When a small child has a paddy because they want their sisters lolly as well as their own you don’t cave in an give them the lolly, actions like this make terrible adults and Disney did just that with this cancellation. Rather than doing the sensible thing and ignoring the whole farce they actually reacted to the bile and showed that if you are a selfish baby but there are enough of you to whine and moan you can get what you want. How fucking disappointing again, it comes down to the same thing I find myself asking more and more as time goes on, where has everyone’s spines gone? Since when did no one in power have the strength to stand up against idiocy rather than giving it credence. Does it really matter when it comes to the Acolyte, no, but it’s not just happening in the world of TV. We have god honest political figures making this whole bullshit argument and claiming it is the biggest threat to humanity in 2024. Really? Not climate change? Not nuclear war? No? No it’s if Disney has a white male in everything they ever make, that’s the real danger, and the answer is a massive rise in fascism, rejection of facts, actually praising the likes of Andrew Tate. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Where does all this end? In terms of The Acolyte it isn't really massively important, for anyone who genuinely loved it and for those who worked hard on it I feel for them. To have your art judged and eventually cancelled on issues that aren't anything to do with the actual quality of the TV show must be dissapointing. To have your sexuality dragged under the microscope and become part of the argument why your show is bad and then to watch the studio capitualte to these points and cancel the whole thing. Well it comes back to the same argument, no white males in something is the worst issue facing the planet today, but ruining someones job because of who she chooses to love is no problem at all, and you wonder why the world may have started to become woke? It would be funny if it wasn't so fucking stupid and cruel. So where does it end? Where does it always end when a society decides there are good people based on arbitrary reasons, like they are white, and bad people based on arbitary reasons like they are gay. It doesn’t end in a good place.</p>
